        <h2>üïπÔ∏è Responsive Movement & 2D Pathfinding AI in Unity</h2>
        <p>
          For this Metroidvania-style project, we needed a player character with extremely responsive and fluid movement, as the core gameplay revolves around mobility and precision. I developed a custom 2D controller that supports tight, snappy controls and smooth transitions for a satisfying traversal experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the player movement system, I implemented two types of AI: one for grounded enemies and another for flying creatures. The flying AI uses a custom 2D pathfinding system that allows it to navigate freely around obstacles and dynamically follow the player through environments.

        <h2>‚öîÔ∏è Combat System with Boss</h2>
        <p>
          I designed and implemented a flexible combat system featuring combo mechanics and enemy reactions, tailored for both regular enemies and boss encounters.
        </p>
        <p>
          One highlight is the crab boss, which uses a state machine to control its behavior. As the fight progresses, the boss dynamically increases its difficulty ‚Äî adapting its patterns and aggressiveness based on how long the player has been engaged in combat. This creates a tension curve that keeps players on their toes and rewards mastery of the combat mechanics.

          This section showcases an unlockable ability that alters the player‚Äôs physical weight. By switching to a heavier state, the character gains increased gravity, enabling them to break through obstacles and reach previously inaccessible areas.
