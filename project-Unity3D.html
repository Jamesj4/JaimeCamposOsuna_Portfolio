        <h2>🕷️ Procedural Walking</h2>
        <p>
          In the absence of a dedicated animator, we developed a procedural movement system for one of our two characters bosses. Inspired by spider-like locomotion, this character can seamlessly traverse walls, ceilings, and complex surfaces. The system dynamically adapts to the environment, allowing for fluid and natural movement without relying on predefined animations. The video on the right highlights key moments from the development process and showcases the system in action.

        <h2>🧠 Boss AI and State Machines</h2>
        <p>
          The game features two main bosses, both built using a modular and inheritable state machine system. Their behavior includes patrolling, chasing the player, entering alert mode, and attacking. This structure allows for easily extending or tweaking AI behaviors across different enemies.

      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>🚀 Projectile Launch System</h2>
        <p>
           I created a projectile launch system where the player holds the R2 button to increase the projectile’s force. The longer the button is held, the more power the shot has. The trajectory is calculated by simulating physics in a separate scene, with the path displayed in real time to help the player aim and adjust their shots accurately.

      <div class="project-text">
        <h2>🎒 Inventory System</h2>
        <p>
            The player needs to collect various types of ammunition, items, keys, a diary, and unlockables. To handle this, I developed a flexible and generic inventory system using Scriptable Objects. This approach allows easy management and expansion of different item types, ensuring the system is scalable and efficient for future content.
